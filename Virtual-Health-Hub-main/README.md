The **AI Health Assistant** is an interactive web-based application designed to provide users with quick, AI-generated insights regarding health-related questions and symptoms. This application leverages the power of generative AI to offer useful and contextual information, such as disease-related data, precautions, medications, and recommended diets, based on user inputs. It acts as a conversational agent to assist users in understanding their symptoms and finding preliminary health-related answers.
